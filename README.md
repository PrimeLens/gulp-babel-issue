# Working Example of gulp-babel with Babel6 for translating react JSX
I was having trouble with gulp-babel and its configuration but thanks to @loganfsmyth in this thread <https://github.com/babel/gulp-babel/issues/73#issuecomment-172438495> I now have it working.   
This uses the `babel-preset-es2015`

Note: this is using a local install of gulp not a global one. Gulp is therefore instigated from npm run scriptname

# To See Example
  
$ npm install  
$ npm run build
